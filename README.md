# Repository following clean architecture guidelines

## Seven projects

-- in the creation of this project I used as a basis a course of the platform "Udemy", course taught by Prof. Macoratti.

   Using the concepts of Clean Architecture, an Integrated Core MVC-style ASP.NET application
was created with an API and four more class-type projects. Library to abstract in an organized way the layers of the code.
